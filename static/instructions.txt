Create UI templates for the stories

2. branch gh-pages modified readme.md - from local

3 branch to ft1-commit local

4. raise a PR FT1 to gh-pages - remote

5. describe your PR - remote

6. merge the PR -remote

7. on local machine checkout to gh-pages

8. Pull from origin gh-pages (gh origin is ahead of my local)

9. Branch to FT2 from gh-pages

10. Repeat from 3 (i.e. start ft2)

11. Branch to ft3 again

all features need to branch off from gh-pages
